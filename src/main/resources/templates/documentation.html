            <h2 class="title">Frequently asked questions</h2>
            <blockquote>What is a "mock"?</blockquote>
            <p>
                Mocking something can mean a bunch of different things. However, within Mega Mock, when we refer to
                "mocks" we mean a fake API endpoint. Whenever you work on a new microservice or a proof of concept,
                you
                often have to rely upon third-party APIs and integrations.
            </p>
            <p>

                Because of how things work in software development, it is not always possible to immediately use a
                third-party endpoint. Maybe your team is still waiting for someone else to finish their work. Or it
                could be that your manager forgot to request a new API key for your team.
            </p>
            <p>
                In any case, your team is blocked. This is where Mega Mock can help you out. Instead of waiting
                around
                hoping someone will unblock your team, simply fire up Mega Mock and create the endpoints you need
                yourself!
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously the data returned from the endpoints will be fake, but it will at least allow your team to
                keep moving without having to wait for others to do their jobs. This is what we mean with mocking:
                you
                fake an API's response yourself.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="mt-6">Can I use Mega Mock for integration tests?</blockquote>
            <p>
                Absolutely! Mega Mock is actually super useful for integration tests. It eliminates the need to rely
                upon external parties when testing your services.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="mt-6">
                What about testing unreliable connections? Does Mega Mock allow us to mock failures?
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Sure does! Mega Mock includes a so-called "Team Rocket" feature. Enabling this functionality will
                cause Mega Mock to mess with your connections by randomly disconnecting or delaying your responses.
                All this behaviour can be configured to fit your project's needs.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="mt-6">Is Mega Mock free to use for commercial purposes?</blockquote>
            <p>
                It sure is! Mega Mock has been made with lots of â™¥ by <a href="https://tahar.dev" target="_blank">Tahar
                    Meijs</a> for the open-source community. Please use this application to
                improve your day-to-day job. ðŸ˜Š

                supporting me on <a href="https://github.com/tntmeijs" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or by contributing
                to this project. It takes a lot of effort to make these kind of projects in my spare time, so any

                Please make use of this project's <a href="https://github.com/tntmeijs/megamock/issues"
                    target="_blank">issue tracker</a>. I will do my best to respond to any questions or bugs in a
                timely fashion. But since I do not get paid to work on open-source software, it may take a little
                bit of time before I can get back to you.
